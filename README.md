This repository contains the code developed during my Bachelor thesis in the scope of quantum computation. The goal was to achieve perfect state transfer of a qubit stored within a network from one place to another. This was achieved by employing the dynamical decoupling technique, where each qubit in the network is sequencially adressed by single-qubit-gate operations.
